# password-generator
This program asks for the platform and username/email and provides a random password. 
The password is made with 20 characters randomly choosen from: all the letters in the English alphabet, the decimal characters and the punctuation characters. 
As a bonus, I tried putting all the stored data into an Excel, but I don't know yet how to append the data after the first writing in the document. I look forward for any suggestions.

Made with random, string and pandas.
